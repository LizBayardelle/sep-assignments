1.  This basic structure lets people create a pixel
that can only have the appropriate color values,
then inserts it into the correct position in a matrix
with a pre-determined height and width.

2.  To find a specific element within a ruby context I would
probably recommend a "Pixel.where(...)" scenario using the
pertinent information to find what you're looking for.

3.  These are pretty common structures, especially the line
example, so they can apply in many contexts.  Basically,
anything where you have a group of things that appear in an
order and can be removed from any place in the order.  The
pixels might be less specifically applicable, but the two-
dimensional array will be a useful concept.
